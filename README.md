# Gif Me The Weather

# Inspiration
We wanted to create a project where everybody could enjoy and to an extent, feel and actually see what today's weather will be like through GIFs. Current weather applications and websites are boring, so we wanted to add a sprinkle of spice to make it interactive for the user.

# What it does
When a user enters a city, they'll be able to find out the temperature of their city, with a gif provided by GIPHY, which spices up how we view the temperature!

# How we built it
We first made two API calls (Openweathermap and GIPHY) based on the user's input and was receiving the data for the input's temperature. Then, based on the temperature, we use GIPHY's API to return the appropriate GIF, which was shown using HTML and CSS.

# Challenges we ran into
We originally wanted to work with Twitter and Instagram's API, but realized that it takes a long time for them to return with an API key. We also had a problem with Instagram's API as we could not access their API as well.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Although a small project, we're really proud that we managed to finish the project on time, and created something feasible.

# What we learned
- how to make API calls,
- how to use data from another source and use it to our advantage,


# What's next for Gif Me The Weather
We would improve the UI of the website and definitely add more functions to weather interact as right now, we are only showing temperature.

Built With Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS.
